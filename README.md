# Buzz Bombers ðŸŽ®

A C++ game project developed for the **Programming Fundamentals** course during my **first semester as a CS major**.  
Inspired by the classic *Buzz Bombers* game.

At the time, we hadnâ€™t studied Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) â€” only programming basics like variables, conditionals, loops, arrays, and functions.  
So, this project was built using **pure procedural C++**, without any classes or objects.

**SFML** (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) was used to implement key features of the game, including graphics, audio, and time-based gameplay.
